# Sales Performance Dashboard: A Power BI Project for Managerial Decision-Making
This Power BI project was designed to support mid-level sales managers with a strategic and operational view of company performance. The interactive dashboard consolidates and visualizes three years of sales data (2020â€“2022), offering insights across four core areas:  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  Regional sales performance  Product-level analytics  Customer segmentation and value analysis  Built with a strong data modeling foundation (star schema), cleaned using Power Query, and enhanced through advanced DAX measures, this project demonstrates how data storytelling and interactivity can empower better decision-making.
